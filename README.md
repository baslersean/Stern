# websiteNameGenerator
Website name generator in Python

We are trying to come up with a name for a new startup. The name has to satisfy two hard requirements:
The .com domain should be available, and there should not be another company that has trademarked the name.
The other part that is complicated is the need to come up with names to test.

Using the natural language toolkit (nltk), we generate names based on a single theme (ie "mammals").

Finally, we analyze the length of the qualifying and non-qualifying names, and create a conditional frequency distribution for the word lengths of the two categories (qualifying names and non-qualifying names). Plot the result by showing how many names have a specific length (in characters) and belong to the qualifying set, and how many belong to the "non-qualifying" set.

To run: Simply follow the prompts!
